# Simple-8-bit-Processor-Design---VHDL-FPGA-Implementation
VHDL implementation of an 8-bit processor on FPGA. Custom ALU supports shift-right, (A–B)+4, max(A,B), bitwise AND, rotate-left, and more. Modified FSM outputs parity check: odd → “y”, even → “n”. Built and tested in Quartus II and ModelSim with FPGA board implementation.
